# LSDGen
Performing Layout-Free Spatial Compositions for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

# TO-DO list

## Baselines and repository setup related tasksk:
- [x] Setup initial attention store
- [x] Add Attend-and-Excite
- [x] Add training-free layout guided inference
- [ ] Add CAR+SAR based layout guided inference
- [ ] Add support to LLM-based layout generation

## Proposed work
- [ ] (new!) Add object detector based spatial fine-tuning
- [ ] (new!) Add support to all previous layout guided inference to augment both fine-tuning and inference
- [ ] (new!) Add Spatial Attend-and-Excite

## Ablations & Additional feature support
- [ ] (must!) Add biased sampling -- COSINE
- [ ] (ablation) Fine-tune whole UNet
- [ ] (ablation) LoRA based fine-tuning
- [ ] (ablation) Fine-tune QKV weight metrices
- [ ] (ablation) Orthogonal fine-tuning

# How to run the experiments?

## Installation

```bash
conda create LSDGen python=3.8
conda activate LSDGen

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run experiment:
For more details on "Attend & Excite", "Layout Guidance" config requirements, visit: [Config](utils/configs.py)
```bash
python main.py --exp_name=aae --aae.prompt="a dog and a cat" --aae.token_indices [2,5] --aae.seeds [42]

python main.py --exp_name=lg --lg.prompt="A hello kitty toy is playing with a purple ball." --lg.phrases="hello kitty; ball" --lg.bboxes=[[[0.1,0.2,0.5,0.8]],[[0.75,0.6,0.95,0.8]]]
```

## Currently supported tasks:
* Attend-and-Excite ("aae") -- only inference
* Layout Guided inference ('lg") --only inference
