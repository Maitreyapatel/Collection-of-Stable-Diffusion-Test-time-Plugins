Following are the findings in overall experiments

### Methods
* Attend and Excite

* Layout Guidance

    - Attention Aggregation Methods:
      -
       - [ ] Aggregate attention maps for specific spatial resolution
         - [ ] (8x8)
         - [x] (16x16)
         - [ ] (32x32)
       - [ ] Aggregate attention maps across all spatial resolutions (8x8, 16x16, 32x32)
       - [x] Use all attention maps (no aggregation)
     
     - Loss scale for unconditional denoising step
       -
        - [ ] 5 (TODO)
        - [x] 10
        - [ ] 20
        - [ ] 30
